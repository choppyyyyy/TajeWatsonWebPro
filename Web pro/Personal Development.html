            </h1>
            <b><u><h1>MY STRENGTHS</h1></u></b>
            <h2><li>Motivated</li></h2>
            <h3>Throughout the years, I have reviewed my goals and progress on a
                regular basis. Seeing progress is a great motivator in and of
                itself, and it boosts my self-esteem. I also continue to set new
                goals, consider what I want to accomplish in the coming week,
                month, and year, and tackle one goal at a time to avoid feeling
                overwhelmed.</h3>
            <h2><li>Focused</li></h2>
            <h3>Over the years I have found that eliminating distractions,
                reducing multitasking, taking breaks and getting good sleep has
                helped me to focus better in anything I do. </h3>
            <h2><li>Helpful</li></h2>
            <h3>The most effective way for me to stay helpful is to look around for
                 tasks that need to be completed, whether at home, school, work, or
                  when visiting a friend. Rather than waiting for someone to ask, I'd
                   take the initiative and do it myself!</h3>
            <b><u><h1>Summary By Pillar</h1></u></b>
            <h3><b><u><i>Pillar-4</i></u></b> Setting goals entails determining
                where you want to go
                and then devising a plan to get there. Setting goals that push
                you to do things differently will lead you to the future you
                want. Don't let others set your goals for you.<b><u><i> Pillar
                            5-</i></u></b> We must
                all endure one of two types of pain: disciplined pain or
                regretful pain. The difference is that discipline is measured in
                ounces, whereas regret is measured in tons. Every day, the best
                opportunities are those that align with your overall goals and
                are where you should spend your time. Get from the day, not just
                through it. Spend your time on what matters rather than on what
                is urgent. We must become the
                architects of our own lives. <b><u><i>Pillar 6-</i></u></b>
                Friends who are useful.
                This is an intriguing concept. Is it easier to keep certain
                people as friends than to make new ones?
                Successful people seek relationships with other successful
                people who will push, challenge, and inspire them to succeed.
                You must be attractive in order to attract attractive people.
                Not physically, but mentally and in terms of who you are. The
                people you hang out with have a big impact on your mindset.
                <b><u><i>Pillar 7-</i></u></b> Self-education is what you teach
                yourself. It is what
                you learn along the way that allows you to constantly improve
                and grow. Most people do not continue to learn and grow, so if
                you want to stand out, prioritize continuous learning. Learning
                is the foundation of wealth. Health begins with
                education. Learning is the beginning of spirituality. The
                miracle process begins with searching and learning. After
                completing your formal education, you will spend the majority of
                your life.</h3>
                <u><h1>How Can I Apply What I Have Read?</h1></u>
                <h3>This book has taught me many valuable lessons but the pillar that
                     I found most valuable is pillar 7 where they spoke on self education
                      and I plan and applying this to my life by teaching myself wherever I
                       can and not depend on teachers to relay all the information. </h3>
